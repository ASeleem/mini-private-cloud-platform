## Before writing new tests, please read the following quote:

> Computer Science is a Science like any Science, and any Science does not work by proving a statement true but rather by proving a statement false. Those statements that we cannot prove false, we deem to be true enough for our purpose.
> Therefore, a program can be only proven incorrect by tests, but it cannot be proven correct.
> To conclude, try to write tests that try to show that your solution is not a valid solution.
